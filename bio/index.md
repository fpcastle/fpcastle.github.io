# Satnam Singh

I'm an independent software engineer working at the intersection of programming languages, hardware desogn and formal methods.

Previously I was a computer scientist and hardware engineer working for the AI chip company [Groq](http://groq.com) in California that deploys LLMs (large language models) at scale with very low latency. There I worked on the design of hardware for the power management of machine learning inference chips, the formal verification of machine learning hardware, and the front-end components of a compiler for machine learning models (MLIR, ONNX, JAX, PyTorch, Tensorflow, StableHLO).

I previously worked at [Google](http://google.com) (machine learning chips, cluster management), [Facebook](http://facebook) (Android optimization), [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com) (parallel and concurrent programming) and [Xilinx](http://xilinx.com) ([Lava](https://lava.raintown.org) DSL for hardware design, formal verification of hardware). I started my career as an academic at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) (FPGA-based application acceleration and functional programming, software-defined radio).

My research interests include functional programming in Haskell, high level techniques for hardware design ([Lava](https://lava.raintown.org), [Bluespec](https://bluespec.com/), DSLs in Haskell, Coq and C#), formal methods (SAT-solvers, model checkers, theorem provers), formally verified hardware/software co-design, FPGAs, and concurrent and parallel programming. I was an early member of the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) team at Google.

I am a Senior Member of the ACM and IEEE and a Fellow of the IET. I am also an elected member of IFIP WG2.8 (functional programming) and IFIP WG2.11 (program generation). I previously served as an elected member of ACM [SIGPLAN](https://www.sigplan.org/). I have held part-time or honorary positions at The University of Birmingham, Imperial College London, the University of Washington, and the University of Santa Cruz (UCSC). I am currently a visiting academic at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/ss2072) at the University of Cambridge.
